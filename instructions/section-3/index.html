      <h2>About</h2>

      <p>
        Hi. I'm Anna. I love traveling, hiking in mountains and baking for my
        family and friends. Last year I moved to the USA from Germany and now
        building my career in software development from scratch. Also I'm a mom
        of a sweet 1 year old girl, who makes me happy every day. I'm a foodie
        and good food is the best part of traveling for me. I'm curious about
        technologies and how the things in IT work. Fun fact #1 : I earned my
        first money when I was 5 yo. Fun fact #2: Lots of people here in the US
        start conversations with me in Spanish. I do speaak Spanish, but my
        native language is actually Russian.
