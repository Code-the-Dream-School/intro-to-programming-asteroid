Jennifer Tellez
About 
Hello, my name is Jennifer Tellez and I am a junior software engineer. 
I currently have a degree in Business Management from San Diego State University. 
Some of my favorite things to do are reading, watching anime, and playing Animal Crossing. 
I have chosen to learn how to code because I would love to make my own video game and one day work for Pixar.
