# Sections 2-6: Personal Portfolio

## Overview

This ten-week project will teach you how to build your own personal portfolio website step-by-step. Be encouraged to really personalize this project using your own creativity and interests.

Each lesson is an individual assignment, but you will work out of the same repository for the entire project. See instructions below for how to submit each week.

Grading for this project is less rigid, given the open-ended instructions ([View Grading Rubric](instructions/rubric.md)). Make sure to follow the checklist for each lesson, but how you implement each task is entirely up to you!
