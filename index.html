<h2>About</h2>
<!--paragraph about yourself-->
<p>
  I am from the blue mountains of the Shenandoah Valley and have a deep-running
  love for American and Irish folk music, solidarity politics, breakfasts of all
  kinds, and economix (i.e., economics done differently, like in
  cooperatively-owned businesses). As I lived in Nashville, TN and built
  relationships with other Southerners, I increasingly felt a sense of place and
  purpose in the South. In 2016, I made a home in Selma, AL, where there are
  good folks and there's good work to be done. My wife and I moved to Durham in
  Nov. of 2021 with our new AL puppy, Inis, to start a next season closer to
  some family and friends.

<h2>Experience</h2>
<!--write a list of places you've worked or projects you've worked on -->
<p>
  I am new to coding in many ways, though I have always been intrigued by
  technology. My Mom tells me that as a baby, she thought I might go into
  computer-related work one day. For me, my first formal involvement in
  tech-related work came through the cooperative sector--specifically through
  something called "platform cooperatives," where workers and users own the tech
  companies they make possible. I took a class through The New School and
  Mondgragon University in 2020 called "Platform Cooperatives Now." This led me
  into a volunteer project seeking to develop a co-op food delivery app. I was
  more involved in coordinating the volunteer software developers among us, but
  it gave me a taste for the grounded quality of building code and the role
  coding can play in a modern economy. I since applied and was accepted into
  Code the Dream in early 2022, where I am learning JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and
  related introductory skills, which will be followed by a course in Fall of
  2022 in either React.js or Node.js.
