About
I am healthcare worker in clinical research residing in Memphis Tennessee. Now a prospective Software Developer
currently learning Javascript, HTML, AJAX and Fetch API. When I learnt of the immense potential that technology has to
improve health outcomes of our communities, my interest in coding was conjured and I hope to immerse myself in the
industry.

Experience
clinical Research Associate - United States
HIV program coordinator - Kenya
Health program coordinator - Kenya
Health Worker Training and Capacity building(volunteer) - Vanuatu
