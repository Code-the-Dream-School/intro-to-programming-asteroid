MacKenzie "About" I like the ocean. I drink Premium coffee. I like art. I enjoy
skateboarding, biking, and BBQ's with friends. I'm a good cook. I attend
meditation groups at least twice a week. Im interested in mycology and I'd like
to travel more. "Experience" I've worked as a surfboard shaper, TIG welder, bike
messenger, tow-truck driver and as an apprentice for a body art collective.
Currently, I work in the Union trades for Local 510. Project-wise, I built a
computer-controlled, propane fueled cannon, using arduino micro-controllers.
