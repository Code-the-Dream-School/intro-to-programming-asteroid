  MacKenzie "About" I like being near the ocean. I fancy a taste of posh coffee.
  I'm inspired by art. I enjoy skateboarding, biking, and BBQ's with friends.
  I'm a fairly good cook. I attend meditation groups at least twice a week. I
  have an interest in mycology and I like exploring places less traveled.
  "Experience" I've worked as a CNC Surfboard Shaper, TIG Welder, Bike
  Messenger, Tow-Truck driver and as an apprentice for a body arts kollective.
  Currently, I work in the Union Trades for Local 510. I build large scale
  expositions for tech industry giants. Project-wise, I have built a
  computer-controlled, fire cannon, using arduino micro-controllers, I've
  converted my gasoline generator into a propane powered generator, and I am
  also working on a 1966 Chevy truck project.
