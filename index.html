Mindset 4.1
– Think of an example of something you have done in your life that you failed at multiple times before you got it—doesn’t have to be coding-related, maybe a sports play, a piece on a musical instrument, or a video game level. How did you keep yourself motivated to keep trying?

At work we have monthly store environment audits. We failed so many times, i started to learn and fix exactly what they would be looking for. They do give us a guard but running that and maintain the issue/store can be difficult. 

I kept myslef motivated knowed that we could pass. I wanted to be the best and was able to maintain a high score. Also meeting the goals of the audit meant the store was running properly with everything up to date.

– Have you witnessed others learn from failures and then succeed? What strategies have they used?

Yes! I will use Thomas Edison as an example. The material he was trying to use for a light bulb failed plenty of times before he figured it out. He never felt defeated and he kept a growth mindset. If he would have stopped his experiments, the lightbulb may have never been invented during those times.
