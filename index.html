        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          Hello everyone, my name is Marcus Hill. I am from Durham, North Carolina. Recently, I have completed my first two years of college at Emory University. <br>
          College is was a new experience for me and although I did not struggle academically I am currently taking time off for personal reasons.<br>
          During my time away from Emory I have focused on building strong habits and improving my mental health.<br>
          Additionally, I spent some time working at a local Ice Cream shop and quickly remembered why I chose college in the first place!<br>
          At the moment I am a student within the Code The Dream program hoping to learn enough skills to become a web developer! <br>
          I believe software development is so cool and figured HTML, CSS, and Javascript would be a good place to start. Stay tuned to learn more about my journey!
