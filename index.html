    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      I started to learn how to code about one year ago. As I visual person I<br />
      enjoy web development. I find the most interesting part of programmimng
      to<br />
      write some code and see results immediately on the screen. <br />
      These days my time is spent learning, researching, designing, and coding.

      Assisted in the quick and most comfortable purchase and selection of<br />
      goods. Consulted in detail, explained the properties and
      characteristics<br />
      of the buyer's goods. Advising this or that thing helped to choose the<br />
      most suitable product.
